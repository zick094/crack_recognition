# README
In this repository, as final project of IBM AI Engineering certification, I built a linear classifier capable to detect cracks in concrete picture.
I used pretrained ResNet50 and VGG16 CNN, which I added on top an extra layer opportunely trained (fine tuning) and then I compared results of both models.
Models have been developed with both Keras and Pytorch frameworks.
